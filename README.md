## 🚀 Projects Overview

---

### 📊 Task 1 — Iris Flowers Classification
> **Level:** Beginner &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Domain:** Supervised Machine Learning · Classification

The classic "Hello World" of machine learning — building a classifier to predict the species of iris flowers based on petal and sepal measurements. Uses the well-known Iris dataset and multiple classification algorithms to compare model performance.

**Key Highlights:**
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations of feature distributions and class separability
- Feature engineering and correlation analysis across four botanical attributes
- Trained and compared multiple classifiers: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine
- Evaluated models using accuracy score, classification report, and confusion matrix
- Clean train/test split with reproducible results

**Tech:** Python · Pandas · NumPy · Scikit-learn · Matplotlib · Seaborn

### 📈 Task 2 — Stock Market Prediction using Stacked LSTM
> **Level:** Intermediate &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Domain:** Deep Learning · Time Series Forecasting

A deep learning project that uses a **Stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural network to predict future stock prices by learning from historical price patterns. Demonstrates the application of sequence modeling to financial time series data.

**Key Highlights:**
- Fetched and preprocessed historical stock price data (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume)
- Applied MinMax normalization and constructed sliding window sequences for LSTM input
- Architected a **Stacked LSTM** model with multiple recurrent layers and Dropout regularization
- Trained model to forecast future closing prices and plotted predicted vs. actual values
- Evaluated model performance using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

**Tech:** Python · TensorFlow · Keras · Pandas · NumPy · Matplotlib · Scikit-learn

### 🌳 Task 3 — Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm
> **Level:** Intermediate &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Domain:** Supervised Machine Learning · Classification & Visualization

A classification project demonstrating the full machine learning pipeline using a Decision Tree algorithm, culminating in a graphical visualization of the learned decision rules — making the model fully interpretable and explainable.

**Key Highlights:**
- Data ingestion, cleaning, and preprocessing of a real-world structured dataset
- Built and trained a Decision Tree Classifier using Scikit-learn
- Hyperparameter tuning (max depth, min samples split) to balance bias and variance
- Rendered a full graphical tree visualization using `plot_tree` / `export_graphviz`
- Evaluated model with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics

**Tech:** Python · Pandas · NumPy · Scikit-learn · Matplotlib · Graphviz
